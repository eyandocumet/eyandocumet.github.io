# Overview

The "Safety Grenade" is a wearable, throwable personal safety device designed to enhance communication during emergencies. Worn as a necklace, it amplifies the human voice and activates an alarm when pulled during an attack, drawing attention and signaling distress.

# Design & Development

As a Project Manager and Circuitry Lead to this project of four, I was responsible for ensuring compliance with project requirements, and designing the electronics using Arduino IDE and KiCAD. A significant part of the design process involved creating technical drawings of our components with Geometric Dimensioning and Tolerancing (GD&T) principles, ensuring each of the 8 components met strict dimensional and functional standards. I created detailed technical drawings for each component to ensure clarity in design communication and to facilitate assembly.

The design process required several iterations, and each componentâ€™s fit was carefully tested. The final prototype successfully showcased our team's design and was praised during the live demo presented to a panel of faculty and GSIs. Below is one of the design drawings created during the documentation phase:

# Manufacturing Plan

The fabrication process for the "Safety Grenade" involved the assembly of two main components: the chasis and the circuitry. The body of the device was comsisted of two FDM-printed (PLA) shells, mated together with a snap-fit.

The rest of the components consisted of:
- Pull-Pin
- Battery (Off-The-Shelf)
- Arduino Nano (Off-The-Shelf)
- Buzzer (Off-The-Shelf)
- Limit Switch (Off-The-Shelf)
- Lanyard (Custom Made)

# Reflection

This semester-long project was an excellent opportunity for me to demonstrate leadership and foster collaboration within my team. Although we faced some initial challenges during the ideation and coordination stages, I was able to guide the team through these hurdles with strategic decision-making and a focus on collaboration. As project manager, I took the initiative to implement an asynchronous work model, which helped our team of four busy college students remained aligned on deadlines and responsibilities.
