# Overview

The "Safety Grenade" is a wearable, throwable personal safety device designed to enhance communication during emergencies. Inspired by the concept of human augmentation for improved accessibility, the device amplifies the human voice and activates an alarm when pulled during an attack. Worn as a necklace, the device’s pin release mechanism triggers a timed alarm, drawing attention and signaling distress. The device functions like a grenate, hence the namesake.

# Design & Development

As project manager and design lead among my team of four, I was responsible for ensuring deadlines were met, compliance with rubric standards, and for designing the electronics using Arduino IDE and KiCAD. Additionally, I was in charge of creating technical drawings for all eight components of the grenate, implementing Geometric Dimensioning and Tolerancing (GD&T) principles. This was essential for proper fit and assembly during manufacturing.

The prototype was successfully demonstrated to a panel of college faculty and graduate student instructors (GSIs), receiving high praise for its functionality and design. Below is a design drawing I created during the documentation phase:

# Manufacturing Plan

As part of this project, I developed a manufacturing plan for a potential mass-market version of the "Safety Grenade." This plan involved sourcing components, creating a streamlined assembly process, and ensuring cost-effective scalability for large-scale production. By considering efficiency and cost reduction, the plan aimed to ensure the device's availability to a wide audience while maintaining the product’s integrity and reliability.
