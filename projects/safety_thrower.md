As part of a project focused on "enhancing accessibility through human augmentation," my team developed a wearable, throw-able safety alarm that amplifies the human voice, improving communication in emergencies. The device is worn like a necklace, and pulling it during an attack releases a pin (similar to a grenade--hence the namesake), triggering a timed alarm.

My contributions included designing the electronics using Arduino IDE and KiCAD, handling design communication, and applying GD&T and ANSI standards to ensure proper fits. We successfully showcased the project to a panel of simulated college faculty and GSI's, with our prototype receiving high praise after a live demo.
