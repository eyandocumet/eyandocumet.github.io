**👋 Hi, my name's Eyan**

I’m a Mechanical Engineer (UC Berkeley ’25) with experience across applied research, simulation, and product development. I’m focused on research-driven and/or highly technical engineering roles.

Below is a list some relevant projects I've worked on in the past.

# Portfolio Projects
## PyroBot Fire Prevention Robot
_**Mechatronics • CAD • Arduino**_

<td>
Pyrobot is an autonomous fire suppression system engineered for operation in hazardous or remote environments. It consists of a 2.5-DoF robotic turret, capable of detecting flames and delivering retardant (water in our case).

## Gyroid Measurement Experiment
_**Metrology • Data Analysis • Scripting**_
<table>
<tr>
<td><img src="/assets/img/gyroid.png" width="900"></td>
<td>
This project explores the optimization of 3D-printed gyroid structures for enhanced energy absorption through a full-factorial experimental design. We systematically varied two key variables within the design space to predict energy absorption.

## Inchworm Robot Climber
_**Robotics • Simulation • Validation**_
<table>
<tr>
<td><img src="/assets/img/inchworm.png" width="900"></td>
<td>
The Inchworm Climber is a design project focused on the engineering, validation, and simulation of a 2-link robotic climber, aiming to create all plans necessary for plug-and-play assembly using a mixture of COTS and custom components. A naive motion-planning algorithm was created for an arbitrary path in MATLAB.
