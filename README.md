**👋 Hi, my name's Eyan**

I’m a Mechanical Engineer (UC Berkeley ’25) with experience across applied research, simulation, and product development. I’m focused on research-driven and/or highly technical engineering roles.

Below is a list some relevant projects I've worked on in the past.

# Portfolio Projects
## PyroBot Fire Prevention Robot

Pyrobot is an autonomous fire suppression system engineered for operation in hazardous or remote environments. It consists of a 2.5-DoF robotic turret, capable of detecting flames and delivering retardant (water in our case). The system supports both autonomous and manual operation modes and is also capable of preemptively applying retardant to mitigate fire spread.

## Gyroid Measurement Experiment

This project explores the optimization of 3D-printed gyroid structures for enhanced energy absorption through a full-factorial experimental design. We systematically varied two key variables within the design space to predict energy absorption. Utilizing FDM 3D printing, Instron compression testing, and MATLAB analysis, we generated force-displacement data and fit a quadratic regression model to quantify energy absorption.

## Inchworm Robot Climber

The Inchworm Climber is a design project focused on the engineering, validation, and simulation of a 2-link robotic climber, aiming to create all plans necessary for plug-and-play assembly using a mixture of COTS and custom components. A naive motion-planning algorithm was created for an arbitrary path in MATLAB.
