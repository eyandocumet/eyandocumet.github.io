**👋 Hi, my name's Eyan**

I’m a Mechanical Engineer (UC Berkeley ’25) with experience across applied research, simulation, and product development. I’m focused on research-driven and/or highly technical engineering roles.

Below is a list some relevant projects I've worked on in the past.

# Portfolio Projects
## PyroBot Fire Prevention Robot

Autonomous robotic turret for flame detection and retardant delivery in hazardous environments.

_**Mechatronics • CAD • Arduino**_

## Gyroid Measurement Experiment

Optimized 3D-printed gyroid structures for energy absorption using experimental design and MATLAB analysis.

_**Metrology • Data Analysis • Scripting**_

## Inchworm Robot Climber

Engineered a 2-link robotic climber with MATLAB motion planning and plug-and-play assembly design.

_**Robotics • Simulation • Validation**_
