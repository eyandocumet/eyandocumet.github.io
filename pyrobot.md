# Pyrobot Fire Suppression
Pyrobot is an autonomous fire suppression system engineered for operation in hazardous or remote environments. It consists of a 2.5-DoF robotic turret, capable of detecting flames and delivering retardant (water in our case). The system supports both autonomous and manual operation modes and is also capable of preemptively applying retardant to mitigate fire spread.

## Outcomes
- Completion of a fully integrated, semi-autonomous fire suppression prototype with both manual and autonomous control modes.
- Successful thermal detection and event-driven suppression response tested under controlled conditions.
- Published a comprehensive [final report (PDF)](assets/pyrobot/PyroBot_Final_Report.pdf).

## Skills Demonstrated
- **Computer Aided Design (CAD).** Created stylish and functional 3D design using Autodesk Fusion. Integrated top-down and bottom-up assembly.
- **Mechanical Design for Manufacturing and Assembly (DFMA).** Optimized design for manufacturing on an FDM 3D printer. Minimized part count. Use of standardized ASME fasteners.
- **Embedded Systems & Finite-State Machines.** Implemented event-driven architecture on an ESP32 microcontroller. Integrated sensor input and actuator control for autonomous operation.
- **Reverse Engineering.** Disassembled and integrated an off-the-shelf device and created a "virtual twin" in CAD. Designed new subsystems around existing components saving time and cost.
