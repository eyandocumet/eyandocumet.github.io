# PyroBot Fire Suppression

PyroBot is an autonomous fire suppression system engineered for operation in hazardous or remote environments. It consists of a 2.5-DoF robotic turret, capable of detecting flames and autonomous delivery of fire retardant (water in our case).

As **Mechanical Lead**, I owned all electromechanical systems on the robot, and worked closely with the electronics lead to create the low-level computer vision required for the autonomous operation.

## Outcomes
- Completion of a fully integrated, semi-autonomous fire suppression prototype with both manual and autonomous control modes.
- Successful thermal detection and event-driven suppression response tested under controlled conditions.
- Published a comprehensive [final report (PDF)](assets/pyrobot/PyroBot_Final_Report.pdf).

## Skills Demonstrated
- **Computer Aided Design (CAD).** Created stylish and functional 3D design using Autodesk Fusion. Integrated top-down and bottom-up assembly.
- **Mechanical Design for Manufacturing and Assembly (DFMA).** Optimized design for manufacturing on an FDM 3D printer. Minimized part count. Use of standardized ASME fasteners.
- **Embedded Systems & Finite-State Machines.** Implemented event-driven architecture on an ESP32 microcontroller. Integrated sensor input and actuator control for autonomous operation.
- **Reverse Engineering.** Disassembled and integrated an off-the-shelf device and created a "virtual twin" in CAD. Designed new subsystems around existing components saving time and cost.
