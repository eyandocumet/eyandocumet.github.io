# Gyroid Measurement Experiment

This project explores the optimization of 3D-printed gyroids for enhanced energy absorption. For our testing, we crushed gyroids with combinations of isovalue and cell density, which composed our design space, and recorded their energy absorption. **I contributed significantly to all stages of this project.**

## Outcomes
- Developed and tested a hypothesis in a real-world environment.
- Performed quadratic regression (R² = 0.94) and hypothesis testing. Further analysis confirmed statistically significant non-linear geometric interactions.
- Established a reproducible workflow for data-driven optimization of lattice structures. This includes MATLAB scripts for STL generation, testing, data analysis, and hypothesis testing.
- Published a [comprehensive final report (PDF)](assets/gyroid/Optimization_of_Gyroids.pdf) and [summary slides (Google Slides)](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1YsgTZT92xVAr_GbYvnbmOabK2q4YTHSgumDWQ4tdrUo/edit?usp=drive_link).

## Skills Demonstrated
- Experimental Design & Instrumentation. Calibrated and executed Instron compression tests, ensuring accurate force and displacement measurements.
- Data Analysis & Statistical Modeling. Processed load-displacement data, computed mechanical energy absorption, and applied regression modeling and hypothesis testing to confirm findings.
- Scientific Communication. Designed useful and compelling figures that communicate data insights and highlight key trends. Technical writing is also included in the presentation.
