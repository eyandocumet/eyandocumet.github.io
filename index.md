**👋 Hi, my name's Eyan**

I’m a Mechanical Engineer (UC Berkeley ’25) with experience across applied research, simulation, and product development. I'm passionate about local manufacturing and solving highly-complex problems. I’m focused on research-adjacent and/or very technical engineering roles.

**I'm looking for work! Recruiter or hiring manager? [Contact me!](mailto:eyan.documet@protonmail.com)**

# Selected Portfolio Projects
## [PyroBot Fire Prevention Robot](https://eyandocumet.xyz/pyrobot.html)

<td>
Pyrobot is an autonomous fire suppression system engineered for operation in hazardous or remote environments. It consists of a 2.5-DoF robotic turret, capable of detecting flames and delivering retardant (water in our case).

## Gyroid Measurement Experiment
<table>
<tr>
<td><img src="/assets/img/gyroid.png" width="900"></td>
<td>
This project explores the optimization of 3D-printed gyroid structures for enhanced energy absorption through a full-factorial experimental design. We systematically varied two key variables within the design space to predict energy absorption.

## Inchworm Robot Climber
<table>
<tr>
<td><img src="/assets/img/inchworm.png" width="900"></td>
<td>
The Inchworm Climber is a design project focused on the engineering, validation, and simulation of a 2-link robotic climber, aiming to create all plans necessary for plug-and-play assembly using a mixture of COTS and custom components. A naive motion-planning algorithm was created for an arbitrary path in MATLAB.
