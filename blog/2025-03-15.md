##Purpose

Why incorporate a blog into my professional portfolio? Because I want a platform to share ongoing work and explore ideas in engineering and technology, offering insights into my problem-solving processes and the evolving landscape of the field.

This area of the site will remain hidden until it's a little more substantial. But, good on you for finding it! It doesn't technically exist yet.
