    {% include about/about.html %}    

    <p>I'm a Mechanical Engineering undergraduate at UC Berkeley specializing in robotics, sustainable systems, and product development. I’ve led projects spanning autonomous robots, wearable tech, and software tools—delivering functional, spec-compliant systems under tight timelines. My technical foundation includes control theory, mechatronics, circuit analysis, FEM, and manufacturing, backed by hands-on proficiency in soldering, CNC machining, FDM printing, and manual fabrication.</p>

    <p>Beyond engineering, I’ve co-directed experimental outreach as VP of the Chemistry Club, led youth programs at Camp Big Bear, and performed with jericho! Improv & Sketch Comedy.</p>

    <p>Feel free to explore my recent projects below!</p>
