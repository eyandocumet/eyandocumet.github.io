    <p>I‚Äôm a Mechanical Engineering undergraduate at UC Berkeley with a focus on robotics, sustainable systems, and product development. I‚Äôve led and contributed to several projects: from robots, to wearable devices, to software development. I know what it takes to develop and deliver high-quality work that meets spec in fast-paced environments. I‚Äôve also received extensive training in control theory, mechatronics, circuit theory, manufacturing, and FEM, which complement my mechanical intuition and hands-on skills (soldering, CNC machining, FDM printing, and conventional manufacturing, among others).</p>

    <p>As VP of the Chemistry Club, I co-directed experimental programs and public outreach. I serve as a youth leader at the Santa Monica Family YMCA‚Äôs Camp Big Bear and bring creative energy as a performer with jericho! Improv & Sketch Comedy.</p>

    <p>Outside the lab and shop, I enjoy hiking, cooking, and tabletop games‚Äîcreative outlets that sharpen my problem-solving and keep me grounded. Proud to represent the Berkeley engineering community. Go Bears! üêª</p>
