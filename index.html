    </div>

    <p>As an undergraduate Mechanical Engineering student at UC Berkeley, I bring a unique combination of technical expertise, leadership experience, and a passion for innovation. With hands-on experience in robotics, sustainable engineering, and advanced technologies, I've contributed to impactful projects including rear suspension development for CalSol, robotics systems, and product development. My solid foundation in mechanical design, FEA analysis, product development, and prototyping enables me to tackle complex engineering challenges with precision.</p>

    <p>In addition to my technical capabilities, I've taken on leadership roles that have honed my communication and problem-solving skills. As Vice President of the Chemistry Club, I co-led experimental design initiatives and managed critical procurement logistics, ensuring projects were executed efficiently.</p>

    <p>My extracurricular involvement, including directing an improv comedy troupe and volunteering as a summer camp counselor, has further strengthened my ability to foster collaboration, motivate teams, and adapt quickly to changing circumstances. At the summer camp, I helped create engaging activities and led groups of campers in team-building exercises, fostering leadership and resilience in others.</p>
