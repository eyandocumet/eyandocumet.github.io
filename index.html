  {% include about/about.html %} <!-- Heading -->

  <p>As an undergraduate Mechanical Engineering student at UC Berkeley, I bring a unique combination of technical expertise, leadership experience, and a passion for innovation. With hands-on experience in robotics, sustainable engineering, and advanced technologies, I've contributed to impactful projects including rear suspension development for CalSol, robotics systems, and product development. My solid foundation in mechanical design, FEA analysis, product development, and prototyping enables me to tackle complex engineering challenges with precision.</p>

  <p>Beyond my technical achievments, my leadership roles have sharpened my ability to communicate and solve problems effectively. As Vice President of the Chemistry Club, I co-led experimental design and public outreach programs. I also actively volunteer as a leader at the Santa Monica Family YMCA‚Äôs Camp Big Bear, and contribute creatively as a member of jericho! Improv & Sketch Comedy. In my free time, I love cooking, the outdoors, and tabletop gaming.
Me at Star Party 2023! Hiking through King's Canyon, Summer 2024.</p>

  <p>I am committed to driving innovation, sustainability, and teamwork, and I bring these qualities to every project I undertake‚Äîmaking me a valuable asset to any engineering team or organization. Proud to be part of the UC Berkeley community. Go Bears! üêª</p>
