# Inchworm Robot Design

The Inchworm Climber is a design project focused on the engineering, validation, and simulation of a 2-link robotic climber, aiming to create all plans necessary for plug-and-play assembly using a mixture of COTS and custom components. A naive motion-planning algorithm was created for an arbitrary path.

Designs were completed in Autodesk Fusion, and validation sims were created and performed in MATLAB.

## Outcomes
- Full CAD and circuitry Design in Autodesk Fusion
- Proved feasibility of design and operation using custom scripting.
- Creation of naive motion control algorithm for arbitrary path profiles from -90° to 90°
- Published a comprehensive [final report (Google Slides)](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1YYxPU4BLg0zNh9PkcbEtMXNPjHYpkNcNU45CamPC_mA/edit?slide=id.g39c02b28963_0_0#slide=id.g39c02b28963_0_0).

## Skills Demonstrated
- **Mechanical Design & Motion Analysis.** Developed rigid inchworm robot kinematics, optimized link lengths, and calculated joint torques for quasi-static locomotion.
- **Embedded Systems and Electronics.** Created hypothetical circuitry design for ESP32-based tethered design.-
- **CAD & Simulation Verification.** Modeled full assembly in CAD, implemented 2D custom IK solver, and verified motion and component performance.
